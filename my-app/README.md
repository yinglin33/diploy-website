# My App

A React + TypeScript + Vite application.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to run the project locally:

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server. Open your browser and go to the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

### 3. Build for Production (Optional)

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `dist` folder.

### 4. Preview Production Build (Optional)

```bash
npm run preview
```

This serves the production build locally for testing.
